# OSUE-Solutions-TUWien
My solutions for OSUE. Feel free to use them as a starting point. Specially, if you are new to C-Programming, it can be quite overwhelming to get started with C. Take more time for the first assignment. C syntax can be challenging.

Even though, I have full points on almost every assignment. It doesn't mean, they are 100% right. They put a lot of value on defensive programming and depending on the tutor, you may or may not get away with it. Tip: Always check for return value of a function (e.g. malloc).
